#while loops
#loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times


#First we usually check the condition, if it is true then we execute the code inside the loop, and then we update the variable that is used in the condition.
#The variable that is used is called TODO: iterator variable, while the process of running the loop is called FIXME:iteration.

# p=1
# while p<=5:
#     print("Panav")
#     p+=1
# print(p)
# print("Done with while loop")

# p=5
# while p>=1:
#     print("Panav")
#     p-=1
